Description: We present 'FACT' (Feature Attributions for ClusTering), a
  framework for unsupervised interpretation methods that can be used with an 
  arbitrary clustering algorithm. The package is capable of re-assigning instances to
  clusters (algorithm agnostic), preserves the integrity of the data and does
  not introduce additional models. 'FACT' is inspired by the principles of
  model-agnostic interpretation in supervised learning. Therefore, some of the
  methods presented are based on 'iml', a R Package for Interpretable Machine
  Learning by Christoph Molnar, Giuseppe Casalicchio, and Bernd Bischl (2018)
