Description: We present 'FACT' (Feature Attributions for ClusTering), a framework for
  framework for unsupervised interpretation methods that can be used with any
  any clustering algorithm capable of re-assigning instances to clusters (algorithm agnostic),
  preserves the integrity of the data and does not introduce additional models.
  'FACT' is inspired by the principles of model-agnostic interpretation in 
  supervised learning. Therefore, some of the methods presented are based on 'iml':

  Giuseppe Casalicchio, and Bernd Bischl (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00786>.
