Description: We present FACT (Feature Attributions for ClusTering), a
  framework that is compatible with any clustering algorithm able to reassign
  instances to clusters (algorithm-agnostic), preserves the integrity of the data,
  and does not introduce additional models. FACT is inspired by principles from
  model-agnostic interpretations in Supervised Learning which detach the
  interpretation method from the model, thereby detaching the interpretation
  method from the clustering algorithm. Therefore, some of the introduced methods 
  build upon iml: An R package for Interpretable Machine Learning from 
  Christoph Molnar, Giuseppe Casalicchio, and Bernd Bischl (2018)
