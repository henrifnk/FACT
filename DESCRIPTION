Description: We present `FACT` (Feature Attributions for ClusTering), a
  framework for unsupervised interpretations methods that can be combined with
  any clustering algorithm able to reassign instances to clusters (algorithm-agnostic),
  preserves the integrity of the data, and does not introduce additional models.
  `FACT` is inspired by principles from model-agnostic interpretations in 
  Supervised Learning. Therefore, some of the introduced methods build upon `iml`:
  An R package for Interpretable Machine Learning from Christoph Molnar,
  Giuseppe Casalicchio, and Bernd Bischl (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00786>.
